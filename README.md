# Temple of Elemental Evil Portrait Packs
My Portrait Packs for the game Temple of Elemental Evil.

###My Current Packs:

Eberron Pack - contains portraits made from the artwork found in Eberron D&D 3.5 sourcebooks

DnD5e Pack - contains portraits made from the artwork found in the D&D 5e PHB

TieflingsAndAasimars Pack - Contains portraits made from pictures of Tieflings and Aasimars from several D&D 3.5 and 5e books. 

## Installation
Depending on your setup follow the appropriate installation instructions

### Temple+ (with or without Co8)
copy the pack folders into the \data\art\interface\portraits folder in your game's directory
start game and enjoy!

### Circle of Eight Modpack (without Temple+)
without Temple+ you can only use one portraits pack at a time.
to use one of these:
copy the contents of one of the portrait pack folders into the \data\art\interface\portraits folder
(there should be no subfolders/subdirectories in the portraits folder)
start game and enjoy!

### Regular Game (no mods)
I don't play without the above 2 mods installed (Circle of Eight Modpack and Temple+). you should be able to install like for the Circle of Eight instructions above but I'm not doing a clean install to find out. if anyone can confirm that those instructions work I'd appreciate it. 

All Artwork (c)Copywrite of their respective owners.
